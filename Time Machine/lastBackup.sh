# Version History
# 1.0 - original attribute by JAMF Software supporting OS X 10.8 and lower.
# 1.1 - added ability to check status in OS X 10.9 Mavericks.
# 1.2 - Optimized the Command to find the latest TimeMachine-Backup-date on OS X 10.9 Mavericks.
# 1.3 - Updated to include support for Yosemite and El Capitan

# Determine the OS Version
